# High-Low-Game
A number guessing high low game in c++ 
HIGH LOW GAME is an interesting game where a player is asked to guess a number that has already been thought by your PC. Player will get certain number of chances depending on the range of numbers he/she enters. I have used binary file handling with classes. 

For example:- If a player wants to guess the number till 1024 then the player will be provided 11 chances to guess.

FILE HANDLING :- 
Concept in C++ language is used for store permanently in computer. Using file handling we can store our data in secondary memory (Hard Disk). 

Why Use FILE HANDLING ? :- 
1)	For permanent storage.
2)	The transfer of input – data or output – data from one computer to another can be easily done by using files.
3)	For read and write from a file you need another standard C++ library called fstream, which defines three new data types.
